# MRC CBU Example user scripts and task lists
This directory contains example scripts that require access to the CBU imaging system to
run. We include them here to illustrate advanced AA applications that have yet to find
their way into analyses of fully open datasets (but please note that many examples use
CamCAN, for which you can request access even if you are not a member of CBU).

For an automated test, see `aa_testcode/aatest`.
